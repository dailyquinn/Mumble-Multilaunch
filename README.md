# Mumble-Multilaunch
A simple script to launch multiple, independent isntances of the Mumble VOIP client.


This script is intended to be placed in a _secondary_ copy of mumble that has already been set up with a configuration override file. (mumble.ini)

Simply download "DualMumble.exe" or "DualMumble.bat", copy it into your secondary mumble folder, and launch. No mucking about with shortcuts!

If you have additional mumble clients you need to launch, instead you should use "MultiMumble.exe" or "MultiMumble.bat".
With these, you are given the option to give the script an infinite number of directories for additional clients after launching the first two.

This script was written as a .bat file, and then repackaged as an executable for your convenience using Bat To EXE by Fatih Kodak. I _would_ link to the github repo, but it appears to have been deleted.
The .bat _will_ work as a standalone, I repackaged it solely for ease of use. (e.g. adding shortcuts to desktop, start menu, and/or taskbar)
